Note:
If you are using chrome you'll need to set chrome to accept the self certified certificate

1. Go to chorme settings
2. In the 'Privacy and security' section go to 'Security'
3. Go to the 'Manage certificates' link
4. In the 'Certificates' window, Import the 'cert.pem' provided in the ssl dir
5. (optional?) To see the cert in the imported list, we had to import it to the 'Trusted Root Certification Authorities'

The ssl folder is only included in the git repo for grading reasons.
